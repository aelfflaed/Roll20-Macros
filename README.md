Roll20 Macros

Intended for use with the "D&D 5E by Roll20" character sheet.  Other sheets will have different fields names so YMMV.

These macros for Roll20 were shared with me by another GM.  They were found in online forums, source unknown to me.  
I've used them as a starting point & am attempting to break them down into less of a wall of text.

Note:  If previously saved macros are opened in Roll20, they must be updated as any HTML will get parsed & it will break the code.
