Roll20 Macros


These macros for Roll20 were shared with me by another GM.  They were found in online forums, source unknown to me.  
I've used them as a starting point & am attempting to break them down into less of a wall of text.

Note:  If if previously saved macros are opened in Roll20, they must be updated as any HTML will get parsed & it will break the code.
